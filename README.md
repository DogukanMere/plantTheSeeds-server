## What is it about? ##
People are becoming more and more interested in organic farming as a result of the prevalence of genetically modified fruits and vegetables. Due to the time and space requirements of planting, many people do not have the opportunity to do so. I have therefore developed a project concept that will assist people with their needs.
## How it will work: ##
Farmers will use their own land to make profits. In essence, users/consumers will rent farmers land as well as labour power in order to have any vegetable or fruit they choose. Simplistic flow is provided below:
   
1. The website will use registration feature. In order to use the website's functions, both administrators and users must register for an account.
2. Farmers/Business owners will add each seed they have for both vegetables and fruits into the system, along with price and a general description of each planting procedure, so that it will be visible to consumers on the website.
3. Customers will select product(s) from the website, and their order will be added to the admin's list of orders.
4. Farmers will begin the planting process, and the system will provide customers an estimated harvest time.
5. Users can make a request to see their purchased product on field.
6. The product will be shipped to the address after it is ready and being collected by farmers.


Since not every person purchase good from farmer's markets or grows their own food, this system does not address everyone, but people interested in planting their own products. However, the urban environment does not give everyone the opportunity to have land or area to grow their own crops. Therefore, this system will help these individuals to use farmers’ land.
There are some benefits of this system for both farmers and users:

## Benefits ##
#### -> Benefits of using this system for Users:
- Users are receiving 100% organic products.
- Users can visit rural areas and participate in agricultural activities which
will raises public awareness of both how hard farmers are working and
where these products come from.
- Users have a chance to visit their products whenever you want to see the
process. Additionally, they can learn every step and necessary knowledge needed to plant and cultivate a seed from a farmer which will also strengthen the interaction between farmers and people living in urban areas.
 
#### -> Benefits for Farmers:
 
With the help of this system, farmers will be able to get paid prior to planting, meaning they will start to earn as soon as a user makes a purchase. In other words, farmers will relieve certain worries (concerns) arising from the traditional farming system. What are these concerns?
With the traditional farming:
 
- Crops are not always giving 100% yield, so they might earn less than they expected
- Nobody is giving a guarantee that all products are going to be sold. There might be leftover products which is a loss for farmers as well.
However, this application will help farmers not to worry about “selling the product part” with the traditional way if they get paid before they even start growing a product. System is selling only seeds/crops for vegetables and fruit, not selling the desired product itself. Therefore, even if there is an unexpected yield after harvest, it will not affect the farmers directly.
